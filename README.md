# Sentiment_Analysis
Here I have implemented BPE tokenization algorithm for subword tokenization(from scratch) and classified using classical ML models.
Then, using spacy tokenizer and word2vec embeddings.
Then, using spacy tokenizer and spacy's predefined embeddings.
Then, using BERT transformer model(for->  tokenization , embeddings, classification).

Comparing all these 4 models , the model which i have implemented using bert performed better than others
