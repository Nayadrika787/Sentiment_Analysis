# Sentiment_Analysis
Here I have implemented BPE tokenization algorithm for subword tokenization(from scratch) and classified using classical ML models.
Then, using spacy tokenizer and word2vec embeddings.
Then, using spacy tokenizer and spacy's predefined embeddings.
Then, using BERT transformer model(for->  tokenization , embeddings, classification).
